## Does cytisine work? 

The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer used what was widely known about cytisine to create a synthetic derivative called *varenicline*, which was then patented in various markets. 

In 2006, varenicline was granted priority review by the FDA, which expedited the review process to six months instead of the normal ten months.

The synthetic cousin was marketed as Chantix in the US, and Champix abroad. It retailed in the United States at roughly ten times the cost of the plant-based supplement from other countries. It was one of Pfizer's top 250 most lucrative medicines. 

In July 2021, Pfizer drug was recalled due to a impurity associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans. 

Within two weeks, the FDA [issued a notice](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-and-press-announcements-nitrosamine-varenicline-chantix) that it would allow distribution of tablets with unsafe levels of a known carcinogen (nitrosamine) to the public, stating publicly: 

> The health benefits of stopping smoking outweigh the cancer risk from the nitrosamine impurity in varenicline.

Pfizer expanded the scope of the recall three more times with additional lots after finding more impurities. The FDA reiterated guidance that patients should keep taking medicine with impunities associated with a potential increased cancer risk in humans.

However, because cytisine is not an approved treatment for nicotine cessation in the United States, we DO NOT and CANNOT LEGALLY directly answer the question of whether cytisine is effective for smoking cession, because such claims cannot be made, in the interest of public safety and science—in the US.

## Can I buy cytisine in the US? 

NO. 

The Food and Drug Administration has NOT approved cytisine as a treatment for quitting nicotine.

Cytisine is a plant that cannot be patented. The plant that it's derived from can grow in most of the US. 

There *seeds* are available for sale in the US online.

But there is no legal way that a pharmaceutical giant can price gouge a captive market on a vertical demand curve for a plant supplement. 

In August 2024, researchers estimated that making cytisine available immediately could lead approximately 71 000 more people to quit smoking over 1 year and maintain long-term abstinence, producing more than **500,000 additional life-years.** Each additional year of delay in the availability of cytisine might reduce population-level life expectancy by [10,000 years.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2822687)

So, ask your doctor if more **life-years®** are right for you, TODAY.
